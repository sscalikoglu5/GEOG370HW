<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Serdar Calikoglu</h2>
<h3>The ratio I created was from looking at the population of college or associate's degree attainment per county and dividing that by the total population for that county. The reason I chose that ratio is because I was curious to see how each county varies between how many go to college.</h3>

<p>Equal Interval </p>

    </a>
    <p> A pro to Equal Interval mode is that every color has an equal interval meaning the colors do not skew the data. A con of this is that it is hard to distinguish between colors in the state of Florida.</p>
    <p>Equal Quantile </p>

        </a>
        <p> A pro to Equal Quantile is that it is easy to distinguish between each county in the chloropleth. A con to this mode is that colors are not consistent with the ratio numbers.</p>
        <p>Natural Breaks </p>

            <img src="hw6part2naturalbreaks.png" alt="your map" width='500px'>
            </a>
 <p> A pro to Natural Breaks is that it organizes the ratio is a way that is easy to understand. A con to this method that it can be hard to distinguish between different areas in Florida.</p>
