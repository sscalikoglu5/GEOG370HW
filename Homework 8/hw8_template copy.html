<h1>Homework 8 </h1>
<h2>Serdar Calikoglu</h2>
<h3> For this assignment I wanted to answer the question of how close public water supplies are to Permitted Solid Waste Facilities which include places like landfills and septage tanks. My inspiration for this question was wondering if public water supplies in Orange county can be contaminated by Solid Waste Facilities. The two geoprocessing methods that I used was buffer and intersection. I used a 5 and 10 mile buffer around the only Solid Waste Facility in Orange County. This showed a radius where the reader can see which public watter sites are in that radius. I then used intersection to show which ones are in the 5 mile radius as those are the closest and most likely to be contaminated. </h3>
